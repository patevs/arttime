       artprint - print text art from arttime's collection

[34m[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       artprint [[35m[4mOPTION[0m[4m[24m]...

[34m[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       artprint prints text art with optional title/subtitle in center of
       terminal screen, or indented according to page height/width passed as
       optional arguments.

       Why artprint? To provide a consistent display of text art in multiple
       CLI applications. While artprint is a program in the [35m[4marttime[0m[4m[24m(1)
       repository and used by arttime to print art on screen, it's use is not
       limited to arttime. One can utilize artprint to bring the beauty of
       text art to other aspects of development environment.

       Future versions of artprint might have bigger interface changes than
       arttime. If you do integrate artprint in your development environment,
       please check that your integration works well after upgrading arttime.
       While artprint can be used independent of arttime, it is shipped as
       part of arttime's releases. Upgrading arttime to a newer version can
       bring changes to artprint that break the way you were using it in past.

[34m[1mOPTIONS[0m
       There are options to set art, titles, their colors, styling, and etc.
       artprint looks for text art files in a directory ([36m[1martdir[0m[1m[22m) relative to
       its own location. Directory path has name 'arttime' instead of
       'artprint' as artprint is part of [35m[4marttime[0m[4m[24m(1) project.
