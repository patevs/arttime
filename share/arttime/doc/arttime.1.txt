ARTTIME(1)                      Arttime Manual                      ARTTIME(1)

NAME
       arttime - scriptable text art viewer with timer, clock and a free line

SYNOPSIS
       arttime [OPTION]...

DESCRIPTION
       arttime brings curated text art to otherwise artless terminals of
       starving developers, and others who can use a terminal. While doing so,
       it blends the display of text art with functionality of a timer,
       time-manager and a clock. With arttime you can set, clear, pause, or
       restart timer with a couple of keystrokes. It also provides a versatile
       free line of text under art as a space to jot down thought of the day
       or a functional message like "debug the failing build tonight".
       Arttime's scriptable interface makes it possible to display dynamic
       feed of information. Using a simple external feeder, one can show live
       system metrics, clickable news feeds, stocks, weather data, and etc.
       The design decision to unify art and functionality will become apparent
       in next section.

       Animation: Some great ascii artists of Web 1.0 era have produced pairs
       of text art that creates an illusion of motion when displayed in
       sequence. In it's normal mode, arttime can be set to display a
       flip-flop animation that toggles between a pair of arts every second.
       Arttime ships with multiple such animation pairs, one example pair is
       shown in section CONTRIBUTING. With scripts, one can easily create long
       text art animations and storyboards. The installation of arttime comes
       with a storyboard titled "story.batscovid_8b".

       To learn basics of arttime in a minute, run the following command. Next
       section describes arttime's user interface with a diagram (Fig-1) that
       would be handy to look at before or after the demo.

           $ arttime -k learn.welcome_8b

       Section ORCHESTRATING, that follows the next section, describes what
       happens under the hood when you run the above command. Knowing that
       would help you orchestrate arttime's user interface like a pro, or even
       script it as a programmer to create custom animations, information
       feeds, and etc. Following that, there are sections common to manpages.
       A section CONTRIBUTING would be of interest to both artists and
       programmers alike. Footnotes of a section are placed at the end of that
       section, so you won't have to scroll much. This document is
       additionally supplemented with online resources mentioned in section
       RESOURCES.

USER INTERFACE
       The user interface (UI) of arttime is simple. Fig-1 shows it's
       annotated main page without any timers set. Salient to the UI is text
       art that is kept centered on the screen. Message under art displays a
       caption, quote, thought of the day, or dynamic information. Two most
       interesting times, and their delta is shown on a dedicated line of
       times. Everything is configurable, even while arttime is running. All
       interactions with the application are performed via keyboard. Meaning
       of keys can be accessed anytime by pressing 'h'  from the main page.

                   Fig-1 main screen of arttime's user interface

       Times and time deltas shown on the main screen change depending on
       context. Following table shows various contexts and time information
       shown in each. Earlier time is displayed to the left of time delta, and
       later time to it's right. This makes it easier to associate the two
       times with respect to difference between them.[1]
       +--------------+--------------+------------------+--------------+
       | goal context | left time    | delta kind       | right time   |
       +--------------+--------------+------------------+--------------+
       | cleared      | reset time   | time since reset | current time |
       +--------------+--------------+------------------+--------------+
       | pending      | current time | time to goal     | goal time    |
       +--------------+--------------+------------------+--------------+
       | paused       | pause time   | time since pause | current time |
       +--------------+--------------+------------------+--------------+
       | passed       | current time | time since goal  | goal time    |
       +--------------+--------------+------------------+--------------+

       Visual cues like color, underline, and reverse video are used to
       distinguish between times. For instance, current time is always shown
       with an underline (not shown in Fig-1). A progress bar appears under
       the line of times when timers are set. When there is more than one
       timer, a goal and/or sprint number is also displayed. Pressing 'i' or
       'I' lists all timers, and time remaining to reach each one of them.

       For developers questioning how arttime could fit in the limited real
       estate on their computer screen, Fig-2 shows a possible 4-pane layout.
       First split the screen vertically in two halves. The left pane 1 is
       dedicated for your text editor; figure shows start screen of vim. Then
       split the right pane horizontally in two. Top-right pane 2 is where
       arttime goes; figure shows arttime's main screen with house art.
       Finally, pane 3 at bottom-right is for interactive shell. Wait! these
       are just 3 panes, didn't I just call it a 4-pane layout? That's because
       arttime provides functionality of at least two applications (timer, art
       viewer) in space of one pane. Using two different applications would
       either eat into the area for text editor (pane 1) or interactive shell
       (pane 2). Both of those tradeoffs are unacceptable while developing.
       That should explain why arttime merges functionality of a timer with
       that of an art viewer: to fit the functionality of two applications in
       screen space for one. Feeding and displaying dynamic information via
       arttime makes it a 3-in-1 application, utilizing screen space even more
       judiciously. Next section discusses how arttime can be used to show
       dynamic information feeds.

       [1] The only exception to this rule is for the "goal passed" context,
       where an earlier time (passed goal time) is displayed to the right and
       current time is displayed to the left of delta. They are still very
       distinguishable as current time is underlined as always, and passed
       goal time is highlighted in reverse video.

ORCHESTRATING
       This section has something for pro users, programmers as well as
       interface (UI) designers, while still revolving around a central
       concept of orchestrating arttime with pre-recorded keystrokes. Language
       of arttime's keystrokes is all you need to operate it, write
       configuration files, run macros, or script it from a remote process.
       Other applications divide these features into four disparate
       interfaces, each with it's own language: configuration files, command
       options, macros, remote control API. In author's opinion, prevalent
       style of disparate API stems either from the necessities of an era when
       inter process communication (IPC) interfaces weren't stable or
       misapplication of a norm set for non-interactive applications upon
       interactive ones. Whatever be the reason, utilizing IPC can save both
       development effort and greatly ease user experience for a range of
       interactive applications.

           Fig-3 multiple sources for keystrokes and resulting features
                 Shows live stock market feed from a remote program

       Fig-3 shows that in addition to computer's keyboard, keystrokes can be
       fed into arttime from a file, fifo, pipe, or standard input.[2] Arttime
       understands a language of it's keystrokes called artlang. A file or
       feed written in artlang is referred as keypoem in arttime's user
       interface. Some keypoems come with installation, the file
       learn.welcome_8b mentioned in first section is one among them. The
       listing below shows how arttime can be connected to read keystrokes
       from different sources at launchtime. Such examples are shown with
       animated GIFs on webpages mentioned in section RESOURCES.

           $ (printf 'mhello world\njjjjjjjjy' | arttime)
               pipe keystrokes into arttime
           $ arttime -k /path/to/config4
               read keystrokes from a file named config4
           $ arttime -k /path/to/weatherfeeder-fifo
               listen at the read-end of a fifo for weather data

       Acting as macros, keypoems save time and effort needed to change
       arttime's state. Instead of typing long sequences of keys, one can load
       them from files. It is simple to make arttime read keys from a file or
       fifo at runtime, just press 'k' and let the interface guide you. When
       keystrokes are being fed from a source other than keyboard, arttime
       runs in SCRIPT mode. Most keys pressed by the user on the keyboard are
       ignored while arttime is in that mode. To immediately end SCRIPT mode
       and transfer control back to keyboard, one can signal interrupt. That
       is achieved by pressing Ctrl-c on most terminals. You can also pause
       and unpause the feed of keystrokes by pressing 'p'.

       The inbuilt ability to feed keystrokes from a fifo allows one to
       temporarily connect arttime to a remote program for more innovative
       use. For instance, one can write feeders to display clickable news
       feeds, tweets, stock market feed, weather data, system metrics, and
       etc. in arttime. As a boon to developers, such feeder programs can be
       written in any programming language of choice. The interface is also
       secure, as most states of feeder and arttime are hermetically sealed
       from each other. For instance, if feeder crashes, arttime still
       continues functioning well. The interface also gives a clean license
       boundary as two codebases don't overlap. Given the enormous matrix of
       feeder applications and the languages they can be coded in, it makes
       sense to keep them out of arttime project. In a way, one can think of
       arttime as a projector with a HDMI port. Devices you can connect and
       contents you can project are too varied to be part of the projector
       box. More information on writing and contributing feeders is mentioned
       in section CONTRIBUTING.

       [2] While this might not sound new to Unix users, none of the
       interactive applications tried by the author at the time of writing
       give first-class and native support for feeding keys from different
       sources while also doing a clean handoff between them. Application
       writers have traditionally relied on non-native approaches to let users
       connect their application to a source of choice. Though all such
       attempts are marred by corner-cases that make user interface limiting
       and user experience dissatisfying. If we are to call this design
       pattern of arttime as Keys for everything (KFE), it wouldn't be
       surprising to learn that arttime might be the first application to
       implement it reasonably.

OPTIONS
   Content settings
       There are options to control content displayed on main screen at launch
       time. This includes art and static text placed under it. arttime looks
       for art files in a directory (artdir) relative to its own location:

           artdir=<directory_of_arttime>/../share/arttime/textart/

       -a <name>
           name of a-art file from artdir (default: butterfly)

       -b <name>
           name of b-art file from artdir (none by default)

       -t <str>
           text placed under art (default: line-1 from a-art file)

       --random
           select and display a random art from arttime's collection. When
           passed, user should not pass option -a or -b.

   Timer settings
       -g <time[;time;...;[loop[N]]]>
           semicolon separated list of goal times you want to get notified at.
           Each time can be relative to current time (like a timer) or
           absolute (like an alarm). A loop mentioned as the last time in list
           makes the application loop over the list of times forever. Or a
           loopN at the end makes arttime loop over the list N times. Each
           time in the list can be of a simple or complex format:

            1. "2m 30s" (2 minutes and 30 seconds from now)

            2. "May 3 1:15PM IST" (IST stands for Indian Standard Time),

            3. "next monday 1PM" (1PM local time of coming Monday)

            4. "next friday +10 hours" (10AM local time on coming Friday)

           All times should be entered without quotes. Styles 2-4 are
           currently supported only if GNU date(1) (or gdate(1)) is installed
           on the system. macOS/BSD's default date command does not parse
           complex time specifications like in 2-4. Please search the web for
           instructions to install GNU date on your system if you have not
           already done so. Arttime can tell whether you already have GNU date
           installed or not, just press 'g', type 'help', and press Enter.

       --hours <12|24>
           show times in 12 or 24 hour format. The setting, like many others,
           can be changed from within arttime with a keystroke. (default: 12)

   Key feed settings
       As discussed in section ORCHESTRATING, arttime can be fed keys from
       various sources. A source is read till either it's end is reached or
       user signals interrupt (Ctrl-c on most systems), whichever comes first.
       Then control gets cleanly transferred to computer's keyboard. arttime
       can be fed keystrokes from a file, standard input, pipe, or a fifo.

       -k, --keypoem <name|file|fifo>
           feed keystrokes from a keypoem file/fifo. The option can either be
           passed a name of a file/fifo under keypoemdir:

               keypoemdir=<directory_of_arttime>/../share/arttime/keypoems/

           or full path to a keypoem file/fifo. Many keypoems are already
           included with arttime's installation. Prefix in their name is
           suggestive of their function. Here's a representative list of
           examples: learn.welcome_8b, timer.pomodoro4learn_8b, anim.military,
           story.batscovid_8b. If shell completion is enabled, hitting Tab
           should show names of installed keypoems. At the time of writing
           this documentation, completions are available only for zsh.

   Style settings
       --ac <num>
           color of art,[3] value between 0-15 (default 1 (red))

       --tc <num>
           color of text under art,[3] value between 0-15 (default 2 (green))

       --theme <light|dark>
           when given, it overrides above color options (default dark)

       --style <num>
           style for text placed under art and progress bar. For instance,
           value of 0 uses regular underline and value of 1 uses curly
           underline. Style 1 uses more Unicode glyphs, and 0 is more ASCII
           friendly. Not all terminal emulators support curly underlines.
           Possible values: [0,1] (default 0)

       --pa <str>
           char/string to denote pending part of progress bar. If a string,
           its length should be same as string passed to --pb. (default '-')

       --pb <str>
           char/string to denote completed part of progress bar. If a string,
           its length should be same as string passed to --pa. (default '>')

       --pl <num>
           progress bar length (default 10)

       [3] art and text can have colors embedded in them. Embedded colors
       override those specified with options or by pressing 'c' at runtime.

   Miscellaneous settings
       --nolearn
           arttime shows meaning of keys when it is launched. When this option
           is passed, it goes on to directly display text art instead (a
           butterfly by default). At runtime, pressing 'h' toggles between
           showing art and the meaning of keys.

       --version
           Print version number of arttime, and exit

       -m, --man
           Open arttime's manual

       -h, --help
           Print help string, and exit

ENVIRONMENT
       TZ
           Time zone identifier. Without this environment variable set,
           arttime will show times in system's default timezone. Changing
           timezone from within arttime is easy: press 'z' followed by Tab and
           then let the application guide you to the desired timezone. If you
           want to launch arttime with different timezone than system's
           default, you can do so by setting environment variable TZ to an
           appropriate time zone identifier. For instance, the following
           invocation will launch arttime in India's timezone:

               $ TZ=Asia/Kolkata arttime

           Do not set TZ to abbreviated names like IST. Unlike our confident
           usage of abbreviated timezone names, they are not unique across the
           globe. For instance, IST can refer to Indian standard time or Irish
           standard time. Also, every system can have slightly different
           timezone identifiers that it understands. They are identified by
           names of files under zoneinfodir: /usr/share/zoneinfo/. In above
           example, we chose the identifier Asia/Kolkata because file Kolkata
           resides under directory Asia which in turn is under zoneinfodir.

EXIT STATUS
       0
           Success.

       1
           Failure (syntax or usage error; unexpected error).

EXAMPLES
           $ arttime
               launches arttime, shows meaning of keys by default.
               Then pressing 'h' toggles between that help page and
               arttime's default art (which is a butterfly)
           $ arttime --nolearn --random
               displays a random art from arttime collection. Passing
               --nolearn makes sure to not show keybindings upon launch
           $ arttime --nolearn -t "Hello World - Butterfly"
               prints default (butterfly) art with "Hello World - Butterfly"
               under text art
           $ arttime --nolearn -a winnepooh -b winnepooh2
               set a-art and b-art to get a flip-flopping animation effect
           $ arttime --nolearn -t "Hello World - Butterfly" --ac 2 --style 1
               prints "Hello World --  Butterfly", sets art-color to 2
               (green), and sets style to use more Unicode characters
           $ (printf "cccg10s\nmHello World\nh" | arttime)
               starts arttime in SCRIPT mode. Just like keypoem files,
               keystrokes are read from pipe till the pipe ends or user
               signals interrupt (mostly Ctrl-c). Then control gets
               transferred to the keyboard. With the keystrokes shown here:
               "ccc" changes color of art thrice to settle on blue;
               "g10s\n" sets a 10 second timer; "mHello World\n"
               changes message under art to "Hello World"; "h"
               toggles help page to show text art.
           $ arttime -k learn.welcome_8b
               starts arttime in SCRIPT mode. Keystrokes are read from
               keypoem file learn.welcome_8b in keypoemdir.
               Suffix '8b' tells arttime to read the file at 8 bytes/sec.
           $ arttime -k timer.pomodoro4etc
               starts arttime in SCRIPT mode, reads keystrokes from
               file timer.pomodoro4etc under keypoemdir. Essentially,
               sets a pomodoro time management program, changes art to
               a colored tomato, and sets a message under the art.
               Press 'i' when screen settles to see your upcoming timers.

CONTRIBUTING
   Art
       Arttime intends to be a repository for curating text art. Such art has
       its most natural home on a terminal and not on the wall of a museum. If
       you are a text artist interested in adding your work to arttime's
       collection, or know someone who would be interested, please feel free
       to reach out. Arttime mainly accepts individual pieces of text art or
       pairs of related text art for flip-flop animation like in Fig-4.

   Package
       Creating and maintaining a package for arttime should be simple, and
       also a good learning exercise for those new to package management.
       Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions.

   Feeder
       As explained in section ORCHESTRATING, it is quite straightforward to
       write a custom feeder to display dynamic information in arttime.
       Moreover, such a feeder can be written in any programming language of
       choice. If you have created a feeder that displays dynamic information
       of common interest (like news feeds, system metrics, stocks, weather,
       etc) please get in touch. Arttime project intends to maintain a
       separate webpage with links to useful feeder programs. Here's a
       high-level specification for writing feeders:

        1. Create a fifo when feeder is launched

        2. Wait for arttime to start reading from it

        3. Feed keys into fifo as you would have typed them [4]

        4. Don't crash if arttime hangs-up, goto to 2 instead

        5. If needed, send the sequence 'ky' to signal end of feed [4]

        6. Delete the fifo before feeder exits for whatever reason

       [4] Use capitalized versions like 'A' (set a-art), 'B' (set b-art), 'G'
       (set goal), 'M' (set message), 'Z' (set timezone) for prompt-free
       silent updates. These capitalized versions of keys don't work in normal
       mode when arttime is connected to computer's keyboard. Meaning of some
       keys is slightly different in SCRIPT mode compared to normal mode. For
       instance, while in SCRIPT mode and on main screen, a sequence 'ky' from
       the feed signals that the feed is over. In contrast, pressing 'k' in
       normal mode from main screen would open a utility to select a keypoem.
